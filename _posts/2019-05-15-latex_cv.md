description: Custom-built CV template in Latex

I always struggled to find a decent <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LaTeX"> template for my Resume. 

Why Latex?  
Well I (completely) shifted from Windows to Linux, and didn't want to switch OS (or run the Virtual Machine) to edit my Resume 'on the fly'.

The only problem with the templates was that they are often bloated. Most of them have extra .sty files that need to be edited.

So I came up with my own template. This is actually a fusion of many templates.

### Requirements:
- FontAwesome
- Sen

The former is required for the fancy icons for Email/Skype/Phone. The latter is optional; use whatever you like. Both are available - along with the tex source and sample pdf at my [repo](https://github.com/mmg10/resume)
